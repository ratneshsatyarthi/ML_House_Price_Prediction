# ML_House_Price_Prediction

🏡 House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project develops a predictive model to estimate house prices based on features like square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and condition. The aim is to deliver accurate predictions to aid buyers, sellers, and real estate agents.

📘 Project Overview

Business Understanding: Real estate prices are affected by multiple dynamic factors. ML-based prediction helps stakeholders make informed decisions, offering improved accuracy compared to traditional valuation.

Scope:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling missing values, outliers, and multicollinearity
- Feature engineering (scaling, encoding, selection)
- Training and evaluating regression models
- Comparing standard and regularized linear regressions

🧠 Workflow
1.	Data Cleaning:
- Impute missing values
- Encode categorical features
- Scale numerical features (e.g., MinMaxScaler)
- Cap outliers (IQR method)
- Remove highly correlated variables
2.	Feature Selection:
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
- Key features: sqftliving, condition, sqftbasement, yrbuilt, lat
3.	Modeling:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Performance metrics: MAE, RMSE, R²
________________________________________
📊 Results
- Linear Regression:
- Training R²: ~0.65
- Moderate prediction error (MAE, RMSE)
- No overfitting (similar train/test performance)
- Ridge Regression:
- Comparable to Linear Regression, slightly better generalization
- Residuals well-distributed (good model fit)
- The model explains ~65% of house price variability

🚀 Improvements
- Try Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks
- Engineer new features and interactions
- Expand dataset for increased prediction power
